# EthicalDilemmaGame Suite

This project is a modular suite of tools designed to support ethical training through interactive, text-based gameplay. The main application is a web-based ethical decision-making game that presents players with dilemmas commonly encountered in humanitarian and professional contexts. It is supported by two additional tools: a Scenario Builder for authoring content and a Game Builder for packaging distributable versions of the game.

Built using **Flask (Python)** for the backend and **Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS** for the frontend, the system is designed to be lightweight, customizable, and easy to deploy locally.
