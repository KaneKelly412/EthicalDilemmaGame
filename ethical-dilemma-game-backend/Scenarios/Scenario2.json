    "STORY": "You are Daniel Reed, a truck driver working for an international humanitarian organization. Your mission is to deliver critical supplies—food, water, and medical aid—to a refugee camp deep inside a conflict zone. The roads are dangerous, resources are scarce, and every decision you make could mean life or death.",
